# FarmSense: Advanced Livestock Monitoring

FarmSense revolutionizes livestock management with automated counting, classification, and real-time monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Automated Counting & Classification**
- **Real-time Monitoring**
- **Virtual Fence Integration**
- **Scalability**

## Problem

Traditional livestock counting methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. FarmSense aims to streamline these processes.

## Objectives

1. Automate livestock counting and classification.
2. Provide real-time herd monitoring.
3. Enhance counting accuracy and reliability.
4. Integrate a virtual fence for security.
5. Optimize workflow efficiency and resource allocation.
